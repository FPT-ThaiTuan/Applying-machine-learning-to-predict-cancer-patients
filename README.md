#### **Abstract : This project involves utilizing a cancer patient dataset to apply machine learning algorithms in predicting cancer. Machine learning offers powerful tools for identifying patterns within complex medical data, allowing for early and accurate cancer diagnoses. Key algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks, are implemented to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous cases. By training these models on relevant features like tumor size, cell structure, and other biomarkers, the study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of cancer prediction. The results from different models are compared to identify the most effective approach, helping medical professionals make more informed decisions and offering potential insights into automated cancer screening systems.**

#### **Conclusion : In this study, multiple machine learning models were applied to predict cancer using a patient dataset, yielding varied accuracy results. The Naive Bayes model achieved a solid accuracy of 89.5%, showing potential for cancer prediction but with some limitations in precision. The K-Nearest Neighbors model performed exceptionally well, with an accuracy of 99.5%, indicating its strong ability to distinguish cancerous cases. Models such as Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression achieved perfect accuracy scores of 100%, demonstrating their robustness and high effectiveness for this task. These findings highlight the strength of ensemble and advanced models in cancer prediction, suggesting they could be reliable tools for clinical applications. However, further testing with larger and more diverse datasets is necessary to confirm consistency and applicability in real-world scenarios.**
